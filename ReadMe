Motivation: personal interest in how I would extract data from a website and analyse it (e.g. first through this simple visualiser).
	Assumption: data is ingested via the GEWebScrapper project and kept in its format.
    Project follows the MVC Design pattern.
	GEDataModel - Model: handles the data & logic
	GEDataView - View: Visually displays the data
	GEDataControler - Controller: gets user input & translates into actions for the model.
